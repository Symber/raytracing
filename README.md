# raytracer
A simple ray tracer in C++.

objetives
To help us implement diverse set of ray tracng as interactive rendering,colour utility functions and path tracing.

Environment
complier-eg gcc
editor-code block
operating system-windows 10


project details
Ray tracing project entails ray interaction,where we apply the theory that at the point of intersection with a ray lets say point p,the equation of the ray and the point on intersection with the other image lets say sphere is alway equal.
The roject allow us to explore colour function  utility,which with the application of the vector we are apple to write a single pixels colour ot standard  output stream.
